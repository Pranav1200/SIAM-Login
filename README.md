# SIAM-Login

We are required to develop a portal for SIAM VIT, which will be a basic CRUD application. This portal
will contain all the information about the core and board members of SIAM VIT. Please refer to the
guidelines mentioned below and build it accordingly.
Portal features:
➢ Signup/Login
o Signup page should have following fields:
▪ Name
▪ Username
▪ Password
▪ Email id (input type email)
▪ Mobile number (Regular expression check required)
▪ A multiselect dropdown box for the team they belong to
▪ Radio button to ask whether they are core member / board member
▪ Upload profile photo button (input type file)
o All these details will be stored in a database
➢ Page to view all the available users in the form of cards (All users with their profile photo, name
and a badge which shows whether they are core member or board)
Example: individual cards
➢ Page to view personal profile of every user, can be opened by clicking the above profile card.
The personal profile page should have space for profile picture, name, core/board, team
(Research, Technical, Sponsorship, Marketing, Outreach and Collaboration, Design, Editorial). All
these details will be fetched from the database
➢ Page to change password. It should have 3 fields: Old password, new password, retype new
password. On clicking the change password button, first the new passwords should be checked
whether they are same or not. If same, then the typed old password should be checked with the
password stored in the database and if matched then it should update the password. Handle
the errors and error messages accordingly in case of errors.
